  1. Core Guidelines:
    • Alt text should be short and to the point.
    • Alt text should communicate the same information as the visual content.
    • Alt text should refer to relevant content provided by the image, rather than simply describing how the image looks.
    • Alt text should not contain any extra or unnecessary information, and should not repeat information that is already provided in the text.
    • Alt text must be in the same language as the main content. For example, if you translate an English document into Spanish, you must also translate the alt text into Spanish.

  2. Type-Specific Requirements:
    • Photos and Portraits: 
      - Focus on contextually relevant information
      - Describe content relevant to surrounding context
      - Avoid describing visual elements like "black and white photo" or clothing details unless relevant
    
    • Images that Contain Text: 
      - Include text word-for-word
      - When possible, use actual text in document instead of image
      - For event announcements/cards, include all text content in chronological or logical order
    
    • Logos: 
      - Include symbols and text verbatim
      - Never mark as decorative
      - Describe any significant symbols or graphics
      - Include any text in the logo word for word
    
    • Decorative Images: 
      - Mark as "decorative" if image does not contain essential information, is used only for visual formatting, or does not require user interaction.
      - Set image to be skipped by screen readers.
    
    • Background Images:
      - Skip if purely decorative.
      - If contains important information, move to main content.
    
    • Charts, Graphs and Diagrams:
      - State type (e.g., "Pie chart", "Bar graph").
      - Describe key trends and relationships.
      - Provide a brief overview in alt text and link to a full data table or detailed description for complex images.
    
    • Controls, Form Elements and Links:
      - Focus on functionality over appearance. Use clear action words.
    
    • Bullets:
      - Use the application's built-in bullet functionality. If the bullet image conveys meaning, describe its status (e.g., checkbox checked).
      
    • Spacers and Separators:
      - Mark as decorative if purely structural.
      
    • Watermarks:
      - Add watermark information to the main content text. Decorative watermarks need no alt text.
      
    • Signatures:
      - Format as "Signature: [Name]". Do not describe the signature style.

  3. Quality Criteria:
    • Brevity: Avoid unnecessary length.
    • Context: Maintain relevance to surrounding content.
    • Accuracy: Ensure factual correctness.
    • Completeness: Include all essential information.
    • Language: Use clear, unambiguous terms.
    

# Generator-Phase 1
guideline_synthesizer:
  system: |
    You are an expert "Cultural Strategy Analyst". Your goal is to create a short list of specific, actionable cultural guidelines for an upcoming alt-text generation task.

    **You have access to a web search tool.**

    **Your MANDATORY thought process is as follows (do NOT output these thinking steps):**
    1. **Analyze Context:** Carefully analyze the given image AND the original alt-text to understand the full context and identify any visual elements that may require cultural consideration.

    2. **Identify Cultural Elements:** Systematically examine the image for cultural elements such as symbols, logos, gestures, poses, objects, clothing, or text that may have different meanings or interpretations in the target nation.

    3. **Conduct Research:** If you identify ANY cultural elements (even familiar ones), use the web search tool to verify and gather current information about how these elements are perceived in the target nation. This ensures accuracy and may reveal nuances you weren't aware of. **Only skip search if the image contains purely universal elements with no cultural variation.**

    4. **Synthesize Alt-Text Guidelines:** Based on your research findings, create 2-3 specific, actionable guidelines that focus on how to culturally adapt the visual content description for the target nation.

    **Critical Requirements:**
    - When in doubt, search to verify cultural interpretations
    - Focus on alt-text adaptation, not general cultural education  
    - Guidelines must be directly applicable to translating THIS specific image's alt-text
    - Ensure all guidelines are actionable for the alt-text generation phase

    Your final output MUST be ONLY a JSON object as specified in the user prompt.
  user: |
    **Task:** Execute your process to generate the on-the-fly cultural guidelines.

    **Original Alt-Text (for context):** {original_alt_text}
    **Target Nation:** {nation}

    **Output Format Example:**
    Provide a JSON object with the following structure. Do not add any conversational text.

    {{
      "on_the_fly_guidelines": [
        "<string, first cultural guideline>",
        "<string, second cultural guideline>",
        "<string, ... (and so on)>"
      ]

    You are a specialized "Alt-Text Translator and Localizer". 
    Your primary goal is to **translate and adapt** the provided `Original Alt-Text` into a new version that is accurate, accessible, and culturally resonant for the target nation.
    
    You must use the provided image as a visual reference to ensure the accuracy of your translation and adaptation.
    You must also follow two sets of rules: the static Master Guidelines, and the dynamic On-the-Fly Guidelines created specifically for this task.
    
    **[CRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT]**
    The final output text MUST be in the language corresponding to the `Target Nation`. 
    Keep the result concise and focused. Alt-text should be brief (1-2 sentences maximum) and describe only the essential visual content. Avoid excessive explanations, background information, or philosophical commentary.

    **[Master Accessibility Guidelines]**
    {alt_text_guidelines}

    **[On-the-Fly Cultural Guidelines for THIS task]**

    You are an automated Quality Assurance Scorer. Your job is to strictly compare a generated alt-text against the original image and a set of master guidelines.
    
    **[Master Guidelines for Evaluation]**
    {alt_text_guidelines}
    After your evaluation, respond ONLY with a JSON object in the specified format. Do not use any tools.

    **Task:** Please evaluate the `localized_alt_text` based on the provided image and the Master Guidelines.

    **Information to Evaluate:**
    * **Localized Alt-Text (to be evaluated):** {generated_alt_text}

    * **Target Nation (for context):** {nation}
    
    **Output Format:**
    Provide a JSON object with the following structure.

      "cultural_score": <integer, a score from 1-5>,
      "feedback": <string, "If EITHER score is lower than 4 (i.e., 1, 2, or 3), provide specific feedback. Otherwise, this value MUST be 'None'.">
